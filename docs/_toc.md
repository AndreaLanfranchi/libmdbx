The origin repository of the project has been migrated
to [GitFlic](https://gitflic.ru/project/erthink/libmdbx) since on April 15, 2022,
the Github administration, without any warning not explanation, deleted
libmdbx along with a lot of other projects, simultaneously blocking
access to many developers. For the same reason ~~Github~~ is blacklisted forever.

_The Future will (be) [Positive](https://www.ptsecurity.com). Всё будет хорошо._
